Here lie the programming files for the UCD9248 power controllers on the SNAP board.

.xml files are project files for the Texas Instruments Fusion software.
.hex files are binaries ready to be written to the UCD9248 PROMs.
.csv files are lists of PMBUS commands which can regenerate the configurations.

To load the .hex files, start the Fusion Design software. If you have connected to a SNAP board with a TI GPIOUSB cable, the software should automatically find the devices at addresses d52 and d53.

Select a rail belonging to the d52 chip. Select File->import->Data Flash, to load the d52 hex file. Repeat for the chip at d53.

Power cycle the board to allow the power supplies to come up in the correct order.

If all is well, a SNAP board with idle FPGA should draw about 0.8A at the 12V input (0.9A if a Raspberry Pi is also being powered).
